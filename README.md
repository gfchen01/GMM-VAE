# Gaussian Mixture Varitional Autoencoder
This is my work of using Gumbel Softmax to modify the Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder. You can find the technical report [here](https://gfchen01.cc/post/gmm_vae/).
The work is supervised by Prof. Zhiqiang Ge([scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g_EMkuMAAAAJ)) and Dr. [Zhichao Chen](https://github.com/JustusvLiebig). 

The repository also contains the unfinished work of DPMM, in which I tried to infer the number of components by using a Direchlet Process. It sounds like an elegant idea, but the performance of model using DPMM is disappointing. I may take a look at this later.
